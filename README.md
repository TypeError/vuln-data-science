## Introduction

In the modern cybersecurity landscape, vulnerability management is crucial. By leveraging data science, we can gain
deeper insights into vulnerabilities, predict trends, and enhance our overall security posture. This repository contains
data, Jupyter notebooks, and analysis scripts aimed at advancing our understanding of vulnerabilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cak/vuln-data-science.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd vuln-data-science
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To start exploring the data and running the analyses, open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory. You can
launch Jupyter Notebook with the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and open any notebook to get started.
