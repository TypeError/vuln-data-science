    "## Integrating MSRC, CISA KEV, and EPSS Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This section of the notebook focuses on consolidating vulnerability data from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive view of security threats and their exploitability. The integration process combines data from [Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/), [CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog), and the [Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS)](https://www.first.org/epss). \n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps describe how the data is processed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load MSRC Data**: The JSON file containing MSRC vulnerability data is loaded from the local storage. This data includes detailed information about vulnerabilities that have been identified in Microsoft products.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Load CISA KEV and EPSS Data**: We also load the CISA KEV data and EPSS scores from CSV files. The CISA KEV data provides information about vulnerabilities known to be exploited, and EPSS offers a probabilistic score indicating the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Mapping and Processing**:\n",
    "   - **CVE Identification**: Extract the CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) identifiers from the MSRC data.\n",
    "   - **CVSS Scores**: Gather all CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) scores provided for each vulnerability and determine the maximum score to gauge the severity.\n",
    "   - **CISA and EPSS Integration**: Check if each CVE from MSRC is listed in the CISA KEV and retrieve the corresponding EPSS score if available.\n",
    "   - **Threat Categorization**: Using a predefined mapping, categorize each threat associated with a vulnerability based on its type (Impact, Severity, Exploit Status).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compile Combined Data**:\n",
    "   - An integrated list is compiled for each vulnerability, including its CVE identifier, title, maximum CVSS score, presence in CISA KEV, EPSS score, product details, and threat categorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Create a DataFrame**: The collected data is structured into a pandas DataFrame. This DataFrame serves as a structured repository of combined data that can be easily analyzed and manipulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Save the Processed Data**: Finally, the DataFrame is saved to a CSV file in the `processed` directory, making it accessible for further analysis or reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This integrated approach not only enhances our ability to analyze the data effectively but also supports more informed decision-making regarding vulnerability management and response strategies."
