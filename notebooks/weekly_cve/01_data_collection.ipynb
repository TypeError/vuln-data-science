    "   - We are pulling the Critical and High severity vulnerabilities published in the last week from the NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD) using their public API.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Combining and Deduplicating Results**:\n",
    "   - The vulnerabilities from both severity levels are combined.\n",
    "   - We extract the unique CVE IDs from the combined list to ensure no duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Writing the Data to a JSON File**:\n",
    "   - The retrieved vulnerabilities are saved to a file in JSON format at the path `../../data/weekly_cve/raw/nist_nvd_json.json`.\n",
    "   - The `json.dump()` function is used to format the data with an indentation level of 2 for readability.\n",

    "## Fetching EPSS Scores for CVEs from NIST NVD Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This section of the notebook focuses on retrieving the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) scores for CVEs associated with the latest NIST NVD data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps for this process are outlined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Divide CVEs into Chunks**: Given the potential limitations on URL length or API request size, the list of CVE identifiers is split into three smaller chunks. This division ensures that we can query the API without exceeding URL length restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize Storage List**: A list called `epss_list` is initialized to store the data fetched in batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fetch EPSS Data**: For each chunk of CVEs, a URL is constructed to request their EPSS scores in CSV format from the FIRST.org API. The data from each request is read directly into a pandas DataFrame, which is then appended to the `epss_list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Concatenate DataFrames**: After all chunks are processed, the individual DataFrames stored in `epss_list` are concatenated into a single DataFrame. This consolidated DataFrame, `epss`, contains all the EPSS scores for the CVEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Save Data to CSV**: The final DataFrame is saved to a CSV file in the `../../data/raw/` directory. This approach ensures that the EPSS data is easily accessible for further analysis and does not require re-fetching from the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "By automating the retrieval and storage of EPSS data, we enhance our ability to quickly analyze the exploitability of newly reported vulnerabilities and prioritize responses accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "See EPSS at [https://www.first.org/epss](https://www.first.org/epss)."
